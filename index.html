            <p>I have had previous experience in Medical, specifically specializing in Phlebotomy.
                I ended up in the sales industry as a Supervisor, and during this period of time, I have rekindled my interest in coding.
                <br>I found out that there are bootcamp programs that pertain to coding so I decided to explore the option. 
                Prior to this I have not had any real coding experience, however this is something that I enjoy.</br>
