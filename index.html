          <p>I have had previous experience in Medical, specifically specializing in Phlebotomy.
            I ended up in the sales industry as a Supervisor, and during this period of time, I have rekindled my interest in coding.
            <br>I found out that there are bootcamp programs that pertain to coding so I decided to explore the option. 
            Prior to this I have not had any real coding experience, however this is something that I enjoy.</br>
